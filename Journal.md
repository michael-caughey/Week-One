# Week-One
Digital history refers to the history of the internet as well as the collected data stored electronically. From my previous historical theory class I have experience with identifying bias as well as identifying minority history. This weeks materials reinforce what I currently know about historical data preservation and collection. It is in fact interesting that history remains a very male dominated study and I believe this has to do with the old way of collecting history. 
When people think of history they often think of old professors, dark musty libraries and old methds of data collection. This is no longer the case with many new avenues for research in our tecnological age. People do still cling to the idea of an outdated system and because of this the area of study have becom inaccesible to most. 
I hope to use this class as a source of learning digital skills and already I can see a great deal of use in the way of sorting and mainting a clean reasearh collection as well as a more professional and accessible way of collaborating with classmates and real worl applications, teammates.
